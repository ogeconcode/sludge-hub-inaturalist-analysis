        <h1>Welcome to The SludgeHub iNaturalist Maps!</h1>

        <p>This page provides interactive visualizations of iNaturalist observations in and around the SludgeHub research area. These maps are designed to support our ecological monitoring and research efforts, offering a clearer spatial understanding of biodiversity in relation to our project sites.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Last iNaturalist Data Pull:</strong> <span id="last-data-pull-date">LAST_UPDATE_DATE_PLACEHOLDER</span></p>
            <p><em>(This date reflects the last time the core iNaturalist data file was updated in the repository.)</em></p>

        <h2>Overview and Context</h2>
        <p>This work is supported by the **The Sludge Hub & Company**. As described on their website, "The Sludge Hub & Company is a network of Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) that hosts ecological restoration and waste reutilization projects. It provides access, support services, and community to a wide range of eco-concerned organizations and individuals operating in post-coal spaces." You can learn more at their official website: <a href="https://www.sludgehub.org/" target="_blank">www.sludgehub.org</a>.</p>
        
        <p>This webpage was created specifically to monitor environmental changes within the Mineral County, WV region. A key component of these ecological monitoring efforts involves documenting the flora and fauna present, with a particular focus on **pollinator conservation**. iNaturalist serves as an invaluable tool for citizen science data collection, helping us understand the distribution and diversity of species crucial for healthy ecosystems in post-coal landscapes.</p>
        
        <p>These maps help us visualize several key aspects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Property Boundaries:** Observations directly within our defined research property.</li>
            <li>**Buffer Zones:** Observations within specified distances (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 miles) from our primary research center and a key apiary location. These buffers help us understand the broader ecological context and potential influences beyond our immediate boundaries.</li>
            <li>**Species Distribution:** Where various species have been observed, providing insights into their spatial patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is regularly updated to reflect the latest iNaturalist submissions within our region of interest. [**Optional: Add a sentence about who this data is for, e.g., "This resource is primarily for project coordinators and researchers to aid in planning and analysis."**]</p>

        <h2>Methodology and Judgment Calls</h2>
        <p>To ensure transparency in our data processing and map generation, we want to clarify some of the key decisions and steps taken:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Data Filtering:** iNaturalist observations were filtered to include only "Research Grade" observations to ensure higher data quality. Observations lacking precise coordinates or identified to a very broad taxonomic level may have been excluded.</li>
            <li>**Coordinate Precision:** While iNaturalist provides coordinates, slight inaccuracies or intentional blurring (e.g., for sensitive species) can occur. Our analysis relies on the provided coordinates, and these maps represent the reported locations.</li>
            <li>**Buffer Zone Calculation:** Buffer zones were calculated using standard geospatial libraries (e.g., Shapely, GeoPandas) around the precise coordinates of the SludgeHub Property Center and the Apiary Center. These are approximations and reflect straight-line distances.</li>
            <li>**Map Interactivity:** Maps are generated using Folium, providing interactive zooming and panning. Clicking on individual observation markers may reveal more details, depending on the data available from iNaturalist.</li>
            <li>**Projection:** [**Optional: Mention any specific map projection or coordinate system used if it's relevant to your methodology.**]</li>
            <li>**Data Source:** All observation data is sourced directly from the iNaturalist API.</li>
        </ul>
